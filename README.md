# React todo app

In this project I will build a simple react app wich is "Todo list", this simple web page will be built using react. This app was built according to the steps provided in the [React Tutorial From Scratch: A Step-by-Step Guide (2021)](https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/)

It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

- Add todo.
- Update todo.
- Delete todo.
- Navigate between pages with react router.
- Data in this app has been preserved using `localStorage`.
